This module will disable NES/SNES Mini's menu music and play one random music instead.

Music files should be in PCM format, the name of the music can be whatever you want as long as the extension is .wav or .WAV.

Go to "usb:\hakchi" and create a "menu_music" folder, inside this new folder create one folder for each music named "1", "2", "3", and so on...

Put your .wav files inside these folders, only one .wav per folder!
